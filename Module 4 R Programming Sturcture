##Module 4 Programming Structure in R
##First things first, lets call in some libraries that would be of great use to us
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)

#Now, lets define all of the data provided in the instructions
frequency <- c(0.6,0.3,0.4,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.3,0.4,0.9,0.2)
BP <- c(103,87,32,42,59,109,78,205,135,176)
first <- c(1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,NA,1)
second <- c(0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1)
finaldecision <- c(0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,1)

mydata <- data.frame(frequency,BP,first,second,finaldecision)
#Lets calculate the mean of the Final Decisions ratings using mean()
##We will make this a variable called "FinalDMean"
FinalDMean <- mean(mydata$finaldecision)
##Now lets clean the data by replacing the NA value in 'first' with a zero
mydata$first[is.na(mydata$first)] <- 0
View(mydata)

#Now that the data is all nice and tidy, lets enable ggplot for the boxplots and histograms, I am using this package in another class
##Might as well keep using it since you can customize all the geometries, themes and aesthetics 
##of the histogram and boxplot using different elements from the package

ggplot(mydata, aes(x = factor(finaldecision), y = BP)) +
  geom_boxplot(
    color = "red", 
    fill = "black") +
  labs(x = "Final Decision", y = "Blood Pressure")

##We can see from the above box plot that as per each Final Decision value, there are different
##Box plot groups with different metrics to visually describe the data
##Now lets plot a histogram with the same aesthetics and values

ggplot(mydata, aes(x = BP)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 30,
    color = "red",
    fill = "black") +
    labs(x = "Blood Pressure", y = "Number of Patients")
##We can see from the above histogram that as per each Blood Pressure value
##There is a corresponding number of patients value in the y axis
## I altered the binwidth to make sure the bucket width was suitable for this data.
