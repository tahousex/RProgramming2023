##Module 7: S3 vs S4
## I submitted "late" but your time of submission was marked 8pm not 8am and was maintained at that time for the duration of the week
##If that was not the case we can e-mail and figure this out privately but I took the 8pm as literal and not a mistake, apologies Dr Friedman
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)


data("airquality")

list(airquality,6)
head(airquality,6)

#Generic Functions may be assigned to variables within this dataset
## Lets See

airclass <- "air_class"

airquality <- list(data = airquality)

AC <- class(airquality) 

##S3 Function (generic)
GFAC <- function(x){
  (airquality$data)
}

GFAC(airquality)

##Let's try an S4

setClass("air_class", slots = list(""))
ac <- data.frame(airquality)
airthing <- new("air_class", data = ac)

GDAC <- function(x){
  
  summarise(airquality$data)

  }
